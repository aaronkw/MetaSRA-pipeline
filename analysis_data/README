This directory stores the hand-annotated datasets used for analysis 
in the paper. Each file in this directory is described below:

./term_mapping/test_ontology_mapping_data.json 

Stores metadata with hand-annotated mapped ontology terms. This
was the data used for testing the computational 
pipeline's ability to map each sample to ontology terms. Results
were described in the paper.

./predict_sample_type/train_data.json

Stores samples labelled with their sample-type. This dataset
was used for training the one-vs-rest classifier.

./predict_sample_type/test_data.json

Stores samples labelled with their sample-type. This dataset
was used as a test set for evaluating the machine learning
classifier.  Results were described in the paper.
